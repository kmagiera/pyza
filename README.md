Pyza is simple python library for running commands under controll. It allows you to put some constraints for spawned process controlling execution time, memory used, syscalls executed, opening files & that kind of stuff.

This is not a ready product. Some of docs is in Polish but mainly there is no documentation for that project. If you find some parts of this code usefull, just grab it!
